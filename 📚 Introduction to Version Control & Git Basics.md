        - **Local GIT** : **Disributed** so that connenctivity does not block work .
        - **Git** is actually locally enabled , meaning that you can version-control items just on your dasktop , just withh a single piece of software available at the command line.
        - **Easy** so that learninig its commands can happen progressively .
        -  ` $ init myproject ` & ` $ cd myproject ` : To satrt off with the initialization of a project , That creates a directory , a folder that can contain the project files , as well as the control files store the historical elemtnts , source code  ...
        -  ` $ Git add ` : Thecommands that actually notices the files and puts them into kind of holding zone , ready to permenntaly be committed .
        -  ` $ gir commit -m"Importing all the code" ` : Is the key word that actually permanently records a historical version .
        -  **flexible** so that it fits your need instead of the other way around .
        -  **Powerfull** to satisfy the scripting needs of the advanced davelopers .

       - **GIT** is extremely effcient with its network transfers , to make it very simple to send large quantities of changes across ...
       - **Exchanges of code actually become conversations , supported by some of rthe web services that surround GIT like GitHub .
       - **GIT** works entirely offline . commits,branches,merges,re-bases,resetting history , even searching through those historical events, all happened offline mode . The exchange of those changes , ` push ` ` pull ` being the commands that we use to execute those .
